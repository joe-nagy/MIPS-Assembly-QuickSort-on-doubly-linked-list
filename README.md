# MIPS-Assembly-QuickSort-on-doubly-linked-list
Overview
This MIPS Assembly program implements an interactive menu for managing a doubly linked list. Users can insert, delete, zero out elements, add random integers, and most importantly, perform sorting using the quicksort recursive algorithm.

Features
- Interactive Menu: A user interface shows available operations on the doubly linked list.
- Doubly Linked List Operations: Insertion, deletion, and zeroing out elements provide comprehensive list management.
- Quicksort Algorithm: Recursive sorting.
- Should work on any sized list. I tested it on 2000 element list, however if the list is too big, printing should be disabled. 

How to use:
- Use MARS MIPS Assembly simulator to run it on Windows computer. 
- MARS MIPS Assembly simulator can be downloaded from here: https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/download.htm
